# Overview

This application is for people to get orginized in a simple and nocomittal space that is easy to configure and understand. It keeps tasks you do regularly up to date and written down so you can keep up with things because life moves so fast. Ever gotten pulled over and found out the registration was out on your car? Put it down in the app! Add your oil changes and tire rotaitons and instpections. Forget the last time you cleaned your bedsheets? Add in your whole room cleaning while your at it! You remember to dust that old clay pot your little kid made you at shcool too!

In the app you start by adding new tracks. These tracks are things in your life you need to mantain regularly with different parts like cars and houses and taxes. In each of those tracks you can enter in a list of tasks, when to do them, and how frequently. Just simply press the plus button to start and navigate intuitivly by pressing on the tracks and the single navigation button.

This will help everyone keep track of all those little things you forget to do with all the big stuff that happens. It will also keep you on task and you can move at your own pace!
